# My First Cluster

## **Documenting the setup and use of my Raspberry Pi (4) cluster i.e. 'bramble', EDGAR**

### Information about the cluster

EDGAR is a computer cluster built around 8 Raspberry Pi 4 Model B computers. It was funded by the
[Software Sustainability Institute](https://www.software.ac.uk/) using my SSI fellowship
funds towards, in general,
training and education into high-performance computing (HPC) as well as, specifically,
work on projects I am involved with such as [CATS](https://github.com/GreenScheduler/cats).
I extend my gratitude to the SSI for their funding and support.

#### Name

I have named my cluster *EDGAR* after [Edgar Allen Poe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edgar_Allan_Poe),
because it is powered by Power over Ethernet which is
shortened to 'PoE', which always brings to (my) mind the surname of the American literary icon.

#### Hardware

The EDGAR cluster consists of:

1. The computers, to do the actual computing: **8 x Raspberry Pi 4 Model B 8GB**
2. The 'Hardware Attached on Top' (HATS), add-on boards to enable extra functionality, in this case
   (in particular) to add Power over Ethernet (PoE) capability: **8 x Raspberry Pi PoE+ HAT**
3. The switch with 8 PoE+ supported ports, to share the network connection from the ethernet with all the computers:
   **1 x TP-Link TL-SG1210P 10-port Gigabit Desktop Switch with 8-port PoE+ Ethernet Switch**
4. The power supply, a solid-state drive (SSD): **1 x 2TB WD_BLACK SN770 M.2 2280 Game Drive PCle Gen4 NVMe**
5. The connections and separate interfaces (adapters):
   1.  Patch cables: **8 x CAT6 ethernet cables (0.3m)**
   2. USB <-> Ethernet Adapter: **1 x SUCESO USB Ethernet USB 3.0 to RJ45 Gigabit LAN Network Adapter**
6. The enclosures to hold the components together (with cooling elements, as below):
   1. An enclosure for the SSD including an adapter for SSD <-> USB: **1 x FIDECO M.2 NVME SSD
      enclosure, PCle USB 3.2, Gen2 SSD Adapter**
   2. An enclosure rack to house all of the computers with HATs attached: **1 x GeeekPi Raspberry Pi Cluster
      Stackable Case with 120mm RGB LED 5V Fan (8 layers)**
7. Extra components to ensure the cluster keeps cool (see also (b) above):
   1.  Heat sinks, to take in heat generated by the CPUs of the computers: **Aluminium Heatsink with Thermal
       Conductive Adhesive, 8 x 14 mm x 14 mm (1 per Pi) and 16 x 7 mm x 7 mm (2 per Pi)**
