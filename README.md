# My First Cluster

## **Documenting the setup and use of my Raspberry Pi (4) cluster i.e. 'bramble', EDGAR**

### Information about the cluster

EDGAR is a computer cluster built around 8 Raspberry Pi 4 Model B computers. It was funded by the
[Software Sustainability Institute](https://www.software.ac.uk/) using my SSI fellowship
funds towards, in general,
training and education into high-performance computing (HPC) as well as, specifically,
work on projects I am involved with such as [CATS](https://github.com/GreenScheduler/cats).
I extend my gratitude to the SSI for their funding and support.

#### Name

I have named my cluster *EDGAR* after [Edgar Allen Poe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edgar_Allan_Poe),
because it is powered by Power over Ethernet which is
shortened to 'PoE', which always brings to (my) mind the surname of the American literary icon.

#### Hardware
